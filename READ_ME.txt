Memory 1.0 Rules

Object of the Game
Find the most pairs of matching cards.


Game Play
Youngest player goes first. Players take turns, to the left, turning any two cards picture-side-up. 
The cards must be turned over completely, so that all players can see them.

-A Match: A player makes a match if the two cards turned picture-side-up are identical.

	When a match is made, the player takes both cards and places them in front of him or her. 
	That player then takes another turn, and continues taking turns until he or she misses.

-A Miss: A player misses if the two cards turned over are not identical. 
When a player misses, he or she turns the two cards picture-side-down again, in the same place.

	That player's turn ends-and all players try to remember which cards were turned over, for future matches.

The player's turn is shown in the interface by the color of the score field. Green means the player with the corresponding score is up. 
The game continues until all cards have been matched and removed from the playing area. All players then count up their matching pairs.


End of the Game
The player who has the most pairs of matching cards wins
